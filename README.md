Serca-core is the foundational, open-source component of Serca, an AI-powered media search engine. This repository houses the core logic and infrastructure that enable the indexing and searching of various media types.

**Important Note:** This repository contains the essential building blocks of Serca. Advanced features, proprietary algorithms, and sensitive configurations that will be part of the paid Serca product are maintained in a separate, private repository.

## What is Serca-core?

Serca-core provides the fundamental capabilities for:

* **Media Ingestion:** Basic mechanisms for processing and indexing different types of media (e.g., text files, common image formats like JPEG and PNG).
* **Core Search Functionality:** Algorithms and data structures for efficient and relevant media retrieval based on keyword matching.
* **Basic Media Analysis:** Foundational analysis techniques to extract key information from media content.
* **API Foundation:** A core API that allows interaction with the search engine's basic functionalities.

Our goal with Serca-core is to build a robust and accessible open-source base for media search innovation, fostering community contributions and transparency in the fundamental aspects of the Serca engine.

## Key Features (of Serca-core)

* **Basic Keyword Search:** Basic keyword matching (todo)
* **Support for Common Media Types:** Indexing of common media file types (.jpg, .pdf, .mp3/4, .mov)

## Getting Started

## Donations
We plan to host and run this as a service. That is not cheap at all between the web serivces and GPU hosting for training and inferencing the AI models. We are asking for donations no matter how big or small. We will be looking for sponcers and funding, but if your able please concider donating. - Kilroy

**Donations Note**
I am in the process of creating a LLC to support this project. At that point I will switch all funding sources to there, for now it's a case of "Trust Me Bro". I will update this when that is correctly working.
